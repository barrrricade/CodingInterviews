archiving test interview questions for future reference

Test was done for Akuna capital for the position C++ system engineer.

Test was for building an ALU or Akuna Lego Unit.

Concept was easy but implementing the parsing class was slightly challenging

Testing was done on HackerRank


## Review of Interview Process
Contact with Connie (connie.lu@akunacapital.com) HR was very fast, efficient and well done.
However the company itself is quite intimidating.
