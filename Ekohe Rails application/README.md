## Rails application for Ekohe in ShangHai. June 2021
Application was well completed however interviewer was not satisfied with my verbal responses.

Interview was very bland, only consisting of textbook questions. Interviewer (Lead engineer) was not enthusiastic of company. HR replies only the last question asked in email.
